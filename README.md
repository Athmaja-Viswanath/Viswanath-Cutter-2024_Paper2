## Abstract
Gene regulatory divergence has emerged as a key feature in speciation, influencing gene expression differences within and between species. Transcriptional regulation, mediated by _cis_- and _trans_-acting factors, modulates developmental processes and maintains species-specific distinctions in gene expression. Within individuals containing an inter-species hybrid genome, negative interactions between divergent regulatory elements can lead to gene misexpression and contribute to hybrid dysfunction at the organismal level. Gene regulatory changes can also impact sex-biased and tissue-biased gene regulatory networks due to unique selective pressures experienced by such genes. Despite extensive research on regulatory divergence and hybrid misexpression, establishing the relationship between gene misregulation and hybrid incompatibility remains difficult. Importantly, however, comparing hybrids from reciprocal crosses with asymmetric hybrid incompatibility can reveal gene regulatory patterns associated with cross-specific dysfunction. I investigated the role of regulatory divergence in asymmetric hybrid incompatibility between _C. remanei_ and _C. latens_. Despite severe hybrid male sterility, hybrid males showed less misexpression of sex-biased genes than hybrid females, in both reciprocal crosses, suggesting that the outputs of male-biased gene regulatory networks are more vulnerable to disruptions than female-biased genetic networks. Additionally, I found _cis_-only divergence to be more common than _trans_-only divergence, supporting the notion that _cis_-only divergence plays a larger role in gene expression differences between species. Moreover, male-specific _cis-trans_ compensatory divergence is widespread, especially for X-linked genes, indicating distinct molecular evolutionary outcomes of stabilizing selection on regulatory controls between males and females. Through this work, I generated the most comprehensive transcriptomic dataset for _C. remanei_ and _C. latens_ to date, uncovered insights on asymmetric misexpression and identified candidate genes contributing to reproductive isolation.
